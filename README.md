# GrabAttachments

This script searches for messages from in the "Inbox" folder.  For each matching message, it
downloads it's attachments (if any).  After downloading the attachments for all matching
messages, the messages are moved to the DOWNLOAD_DIR folder.  The messages are moved regardless
of whether any attachments are found.
